# scrambled-words
A text-based word guessing game.

The player has to guess the correct order of letters in a word
throughout several levels. Scrambled words are created from a text
file. Each level presents a more difficult word scramble. After a
limited number of guesses, the level ends.

Once in every game, the player can get a hint to help in guessing the
word. In the end, the player receives points for solved words, and
bonus points for completing levels within a time limit. When the first
highscore is achieved, the game creates a text file to store highscore
entries.

Word files in English and German are included.

If you change or create word files, make sure that there are only
commas between words, no empty spaces or other characters.
