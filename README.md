# Scrambled Words
A text-based word guessing game.

This game lets you try and guess the correct order of letters in a word
throughout several levels. Scrambled words are created from a text file.
Each level presents a more difficult word scramble. After a limited
number of guesses, the level ends.

Once in every game, you can get a hint by pressing "H". When all levels
are completed, you receive points for solved words, and bonus points for
guessing words within a time limit.

Word files in English and German are included. If you change them or
create your own word files, make sure that there are only commas between
words, no empty spaces or other characters.
